![Heroku scaling](../images/heroku-features-scaling-dynos.png)

  Scaling your apps is easy on Heroku.  You will see how to use the dashboard and toolbelt to define how many resources you want to run your application.

> **Warning** Scaling your app to more than one 1x dyno will exceed your free credits.  It is advisable to scale your dyno usage to zero whist your app is not in use to ensure you do not incure any charge.


### Challenge of Scaling
  
  The challenge of scaling is knowing how much your appliction needs to effectively scale by.  This decision is effected by:
  
  * The usage patterns of your application 
  * The performance of all the parts of your application
  
  It is important to understand the performance of your app before scaling it and also continue to monitor performance and usage as you scale.  
  
> **Info** Auto-scaling services are availble from the Heroku marketplace.  To use that kind of service effectively you still need to understand performance and useage patterns for your app.
