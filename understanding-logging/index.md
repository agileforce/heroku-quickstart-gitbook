# Understanding Logging 

> define how logging works on Heroku 

  * Unified Logging
  * Filters for different sources of logs (apps, apis, system)

  Heroku stores 1500 lines of logs for every one of your applications. The full log stream is also available as a service and there are sevral logging services in the [Heroku Addons](https://addons.heroku.com/?q=log) that provide things such as log persistence, search and condition based alerts (email, sms).

## Application Logging

> TODO: define the approach to take for application logging for apps running on Heroku 

  How to you get your app to write logs 


## Addon logging 

> **fixme** do logs from addons also feed into the Heroku logs, not at all or on a case by case basis ?
