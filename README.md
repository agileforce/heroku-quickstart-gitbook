# Heroku Workshop

![Heroku Logo](images/heroku-concept.png)

  [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) gives developers an easy way deploy, scale & monitor your customer facing applications without the need for extensive [DevOps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) training or tooling.

  This quickstart takes you through your first try of Heroku, by deploying a simple app using [Heroku Button](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-button).  No coding skills are required for this quickstart, you will simply deploy the code that someone else has already developed.
