# Deploying the Heroku sample Apps

  As well as deploying code via Heroku Button, you can of course deploy from an existing codebase that has working code.  For each of the supported languages we have a sample app that you can deploy, to quickly understand the basic workflow when using Heroku.

  In this section we will walk through deployment of the sample **Java application**.  Its the same process for the other sample apps, so you can use one of the other sample apps if you prefer.
