# Deploy to Heroku Button 

![Heroku Button - Deploy to Heroku](../images/heroku-button-deploy-to-heroku.png)

  The **Deploy to Heroku button** enables anyone with an Heroku accout to deploy an app via the web browser, and with little or no configuration. The button is ideal for anyone who wish to provide customers with a quick and easy way to deploy their apps.

  To demonstrate just how easy deployment should be, visit one of the following projects and press the Heroku button 
  
  * [Simple shout-out app in Clojure](https://github.com/jr0cket/shouter)
  * [Bare bones Node.js app](https://github.com/heroku/button-sample)

  * [Salesforce Canvas Demo](https://github.com/ccoenraets/salesforce-canvas-demo) - requires a Salesforce Org.

  * [Node Articles](https://github.com/heroku-examples/node-articles-nlp) - Node & Express app with Amqp message broker and MongoDB for state (requires [verified Heroku account required](https://heroku.com/verify)).
