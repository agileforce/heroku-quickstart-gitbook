## Production verses Development 

  Production refers to applications with 2 or more dynos or applications running on PX dynos (and any related infrastructure).

> TODO: are PX dynos still called PX or are they now called XL ?

Development refers to everything else (e.g. Deployment processes, Git servers, API calls, toolbelt command, one off processes, etc.).
